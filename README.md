# ScamSites
A list of websites I consider scammy. See the commit messages for the reasoning.

## Why should I trust your list?

Don't. Do your own research. This is less an authoritative certainty kind of thing, and more a personal opinion. Read, use, discard at your own risk.

## Why is my site on your list?

Read the commit message that came with me adding it to the list.

## Take me off your list, 
## ... because I'm good (now)

Sure thing. Throw me an email to martin.hohenberg [at] gmail.com, and tell me. 

## ... I'm offering you (items / money / my firstborn) to take me off your list. 

Nah, I'm good.

## ... I'll sue you.

Good luck.
