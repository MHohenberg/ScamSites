# ScamSites
A list of websites I consider scammy. See the commit messages for the reasoning.

## Why should I trust your list?

Don't. Do your own research. This is less an authoritative certainty kind of thing, and more a personal opinion. Read, use, discard at your own risk.

## Why is my site on your list?

Read the commit message that came with me adding it to the list.

## Take me off your list, 
### ... because I'm good (now)

Sure thing. Throw me an email to martin.hohenberg [at] gmail.com, and tell me. I'll check. 

### ... I'm offering you (items / money / my firstborn) to take me off your list. 

Nah, I'm good.

### ... I'll sue you.

Good luck.

## But you're permanently blocking domains now?

Nah. I check the URLs on semiregular intervals to see whether
- they are still the same,
- they have stopped being scammy (and believe me, I'm going to go through that with a fine comb),
- or if the URL is no longer connected and free to re-register - then the domain name automatically gets pardonned so that new website makers don't get punished for their predecessor's sins.

If you think I missed something, you can always contact me, or make a pull request removing the page from the list - but again, that only triggers me checking it, pull requests never are merged automatically.

## Can I fork, and make pull requests?

Sure. I will check every pull request first, though. 

When you do plan to do a pull request, please sort the list before committing it. We want our list neat and orderly, one line per scam URL.
